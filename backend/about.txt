My name is Suhail Ameer, and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a strong focus on modern JavaScript-based technologies and scalable application design.

I am a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications / Computer Science) graduate from Bangalore North University. I completed my elementary and school education at Hira English School, where I studied Computer Science and developed a solid foundation in programming, logical thinking, and problem-solving.

Currently, I am working as a Full-Stack Developer Intern at Luminar Technolab, Kochi, where I am gaining hands-on industry experience by building real-world web applications, collaborating in team-based development, and following professional development practices.

My core expertise lies in the MERN stack, including React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I specialize in building responsive, performant user interfaces using Tailwind CSS, and managing complex client-side data using Redux Toolkit and TanStack Query (React Query) for efficient server-state management, caching, and API synchronization.

I actively build applications using Next.js, focusing on modern features such as server components, API routes, performance optimization, and scalable project structure. I enjoy designing clean, maintainable architectures suitable for production-grade applications.

Beyond traditional web development, I am deeply interested in AI integration within web applications. I have practical experience with:

Gemini AI

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems

Vector databases

AI-powered portfolio assistants and intelligent user interaction systems

I am also continuously expanding my knowledge of DevOps and cloud-native concepts, including Docker, basic Kubernetes, deployment workflows, and scalable infrastructure fundamentals.

As a software engineer, I strongly believe in continuous learning. I actively explore new frameworks, tools, and best practices, staying up to date with evolving technologies in the software ecosystem. My goal is to build scalable, real-world applications, grow as a problem-solving engineer, and contribute to impactful products.

I am passionate about technology, clean UI/UX, system design, and learning how modern software systems are built end-to-end.
